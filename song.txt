Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?

Strung out on a feeling, my hands are tied
Your face on my ceiling, I fantasize
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it
(I can't control it)
I try to replace it with city lights
I'll never escape it, I need the high
Oh, I can't control it, I can't control it
(Control it, oh)

You keep making it harder to stay
But I still can't run away
I gotta know why can't you,
Why can't you just let me go?

Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
Prisoner, prisoner, locked up
Can't get you off my mind, off my mind
Lord knows I tried a million times, million times, oh-woah
Why can't you, why can't you just let me go?
